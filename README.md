# My React Blog
<p>
This is my first react blog. It is a public forum platform created for the people of my electoral area. When full functioning, it will provide an interface for people to input their name, a problem, and write a comment about the stated problem. Emails will be sent to the members of parliament and municipal chief executive in the area to know the problems facing their constituents.

I used props for passing on info from parent to child and  the dot map method for modifying and returning data.

I made an array of objects using the dot map method to pass them into JSX.
